# OPTI-SCANNER  #

Create an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) App that can recognize thai id cards and get the required information. Save this information for retrival later.

Objective

Develop an application that utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to analyze thai id cards and extract relevant data. This app should integrate with Google Vision API for OCR processing and then parse the response to interpret the OCR results, returning the final data in JSON format. Along with this we would like you to choose a database of your choice and save the results in the db. We would need a CRUD api to create the ocr data, if needed we can modify some data, filter them or delete certain id cards(soft delete).

Sample Thai ID Card Data: The id cards you'll be analyzing can contain various data fields such as:

Name Last Name Identification Number Date of issue Date of expiry Dagete of birth
